	of at least 4 jolts whit the next adapter, so we only can take off the 1 gap adapters, knowing that, the idea is realize how many
	diferent posibilites of conections haves a 1 gap group and then multiply the number of posibilities from all groups.
	knowing this:
	 [1]: only 1 combination
	 [1,1]: 2 combinations
	 [1,1,1]: 4 combinations
	 [1,1,1,1]: 7 combinations
	 obviusly we check that we dont have a bigger gruop of 1 gaps in the input that the 7 combinationÂ´s group.
	the example of above would be 4*1*7 = 28 combinations.
